## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I love these challenges because you can learn a lot practicing and it's also possible to assert prior knowledges 

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 700px){
    body {
        background-image: url("images/pattern-background-mobile.svg");
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
    }
    
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing these challenges to improve my knowledge in css and responsiveness so I can start doing challenges that involve js

### Useful resources

- [MDN webdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - I don't think all documentation is easy/fluid to read but I believe it's always good to read them so you can directly interpret what is written and not just rely on tutorials

## Acknowledgments

Checking the feedback that is passed on the frontend menthor platform is always good, going back to the project to improve it's also great, we can't always reach 100% on the first try so persistence is the key
